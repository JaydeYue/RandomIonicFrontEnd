# Random Ionic Server
Random stuff

This works locally, I will try to upload it to the public web later.

This server demo works and is uploaded to the public web. I separated backend and front end, ionic uses the API from this URL.

# Setup

Using Ionic and Node.js for the backend. Make sure you have them installed

1. **Install Required libraries**

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```

3. **Running locally**

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

Only tab 1 is in use, the other two tabs are placeholder.

3. **Test**

There are unit tests for backend but not for front end, I think testing on front end is best done by playing around with the app locally.

4. **Troubleshoot**

Please google whatever build error you get:) If a build error persists or you find a bug, please contact me through my website. Thank you!
