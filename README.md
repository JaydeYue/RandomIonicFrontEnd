# Random Ionic Server

[Full demo using ionic on Firebase](https://jayde-random-ionic.firebaseapp.com). For this, you need to press 'enter' or press somewhere else on the screen after typing a number for the result to show. When you first load this, there might be a delay before the result shows, but several seconds later the speed should return to normal.

# Setup

Using Ionic for the frontend. Make sure you have them installed

1. **Install Required libraries**

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```

3. **Running locally**

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

Only tab 1 is in use, the other two tabs are placeholder.

3. **Test**

There are unit tests for backend but not for front end, I think testing on front end is best done by playing around with the app locally.

4. **Troubleshoot**

Please google whatever build error you get:) If a build error persists or you find a bug, please contact me through my website. Thank you!
